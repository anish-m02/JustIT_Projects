Here's what each of the columns in the dataset represents:\n","\n","1. `mpg`: Miles/(US) gallon\n","2. `cyl`: Number of cylinders\n","3. `disp`: Displacement (cu.in.)\n","4. `hp`: Gross horsepower\n","5. `drat`: Rear axle ratio\n","6. `wt`: Weight (1000 lbs)\n","7. `qsec`: 1/4 mile time\n","8. `vs`: V/S\n","9. `am`: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)\n","10. `gear`: Number of forward gears\n","11. `carb`: Number of carburetors\n","\n","You can print the `mtcars` dataset in R by simply typing `mtcars` in the console. This will display the entire dataset in the console. ðŸš—ðŸ“Š\n","\n","For more details on the `mtcars` dataset and other built-in datasets in R, you can explore additional resources such as
