We plan to do this when we talk about functions. For now, we simply want to show you how it works. Feel free to use it in your own programs.\n","\n","The mechanism is called keyword arguments. The name stems from the fact that the meaning of these arguments is taken not from its location (position) but from the special word (keyword) used to identify them.\n","\n","The `print()` function has two keyword arguments that you can use for your purposes.

By default, `print()` automatically inserts a newline character after each execution, which results in printing each item on a new line. However, using the `end` parameter, you can change this behavior.\n","\n","Here are some key points about the `end` parameter in `print()`:\n","\n","1. **Default Behavior**:\n","   - By default, `print()` ends with a newline character (`\\n`), which moves the cursor to the next line after printing.\n","   - For example:\n","     ```python\n","     print(\"Hello\")\n","     print(\"World\")\n","     # Output:\n","     # Hello\n","     # World\n","     ```\n","\n","2. **Customizing the End Character**:\n","   - You can specify a different character or string to be used as the end character instead of the newline.\n","   - For instance:\n","     ```python\n","     print(\"Welcome to\", end=' ')\n","     print(\"GeeksforGeeks\", end=' ')\n","     # Output: Welcome to GeeksforGeeks\n","     ```\n","\n","3. **Concatenating Strings**:\n","   - You can use the `end` parameter to concatenate multiple `print()` statements into a single line of output.\n","   - Example:\n","     ```python\n","     name = \"Alice\"\n","     age = 30\n","     print(\"My name is\", name, \"and I am\", age, \"years old.\", end=\" \")\n","     print(\"Nice to meet you!\")\n","     # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old. Nice to meet you!\n","     ```\n","\n","4. **Other Uses**:\n","   - The `end` parameter is a useful feature for controlling the formatting of output in various ways.\n","   - It allows you to customize how items are separated and whether they end with a newline or a different character.\n","\n","Remember, the `end` parameter provides flexibility in shaping your output, making it a handy tool for Python developers! üêçüëç\n","\n","In our example, we have made use of the `end` keyword argument, and set it to a string containing two spaces.\n","\n","Run the code to see how it works.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TfhLqwUZODVe"},"id":"TfhLqwUZODVe"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":35,"id":"2402d6c5","metadata":{"id":"2402d6c5","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714042794999,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":238,"user":{"displayName":"Anish Mistry","userId":"06140341482757468811"}},"outputId":"dbef7a3f-56f0-4782-aa78-789d85ada75f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["My name is Python.
