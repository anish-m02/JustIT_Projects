I imported the [HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv](https://github.com/anish-m02/JustIT_Projects/blob/main/Assignment%203%20R%20%26%20PowerBI/HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv) into a .ipynb notebook as a data frame.   
After cleaning the data, I exported the data frame as clean_df.csv.  
Taking this cleaned data, I imported it into Power BI where I made some visualisations to further explore the trends.
